# Switchbot CleaN Room (SCNR)

> **This code was generated by an AI (Bolt by StackBlitz)**

A Home Assistant integration that enables single-room cleaning for Switchbot S10 robot vacuum cleaners by posing as the SwitchBot app. This integration exists primarily to enable single-room cleaning - a feature not yet available in the official API.

This integration was originally created to power a KNX switch for automated bathroom cleaning after shower use. While it may work for other use cases, please note its limitations.

## Limitations

- Only works in the EU region (hardcoded)
- Only supports cleaning single rooms
- Only compatible with Switchbot S10 (hardcoded)
- Does not support multiple S10 devices in a single account
- Does not report device state or errors
- Uses unofficial API endpoints (may break at any time)
